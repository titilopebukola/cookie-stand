## Explain why we need domain modeling.

A domain model can be used to verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders.
It is a communication tool that defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.

## Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

1. Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users. The markup is more complex than with CSS layout techniques, the screen readers' output will be confusing to their users.
2. It produce tag soup: It involve more complex markup structures than proper layout techniques. This can result in the code being harder to write, maintain, and debug.
3. Tables are not automatically responsive: This is because they are sized according to their content by default, so extra measures are needed to get table layout styling to effectively work across a variety of devices.

## List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>

1. Table row <tr>
2. Table head <th>
3. Table data <td>

## What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

A constructor is useful for creating multiple objects. It is a special function that creates and initializes an object instance of a class. In JavaScript, a constructor gets called when an object is created using the new keyword. The purpose of a constructor is to create a new object and set values for any existing object properties. https://rollbar.com/blog/javascript-constructors/

## How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

1. The this keyword refers to the current object the code is being written inside.
2. This enables you to use the same method definition for every object you create.
3. This enables us to create more object literal.
4. in order to create as many objects as we like, and just updating the values for the properties that are different, we need to use a constructor.
5. A constructor is a function called using the new keyword. When you call a constructor, it will:

- create a new object
- bind this to the new object, so you can refer to this in your constructor code
- run the code in the constructor
- return the new object.

## Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

1. Prototy is the object where the properties are inherited. Prototype allows objects to be inherited from other objects.
2. Every object in javascript has an internal property called prototype.

## Key take away

An object property can itself be an object. For example, try changing the name member from:
person.name;
person.age;

const person = {
name: ["Bob", "Smith"],
};

to

const person = {
name: {
first: "Bob",
last: "Smith",
},
// â€¦
};

To access these items you just need to chain the extra step onto the end with another dot.

person.name.first;
person.name.last;

If you do this, you'll also need to go through your method code and change any instances of

name[0];
name[1];

to

name.first;
name.last;

- Constructors, by convention, start with a capital letter and are named for the type of object they create.

- Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.
